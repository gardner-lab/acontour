# Welcome (i.e. what does this do?)

This is a MATLAB script for computing the auditory contour transform (for details see [Lim, Shinn-Cunnigham, and Gardner TJ "Stable time-frequency contours for sprase signal representation"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=6811462)).  To get started, try running the demo script acontour_demo.m.  You should see the following output: ![Demo output](/acontour_demo.png?raw=true "Demo output") 

All parameters are passed as parameter/value pairs (see demo script for an example).
